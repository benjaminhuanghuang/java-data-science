Navie Bayes Steps
- Separate the dataset by label
- Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each attribute of each group.
- Use that mean and standard deviation to construct a normal distribution for each group
- Use the normal distribution to predict the probability that a given data point would belong to that group
- Pick the group with the highest probability.
